And with all this, very few have tried to look at the picture through the eyes of another person.After long useless bickering, one of the students came up to the screen and, pointing with his finger at the line in the drawing, said: - This is a young woman's necklace! To which another objected: - What a necklace, this is the mouth of an old woman! Gradually calming down, they began to discuss individual elements of the drawing, which they perceived in different ways. </em>
